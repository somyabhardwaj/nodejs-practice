Q1. Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.


Q2. Given a string 's' consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the **last** word in the string.

A **word** is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.


Q3. Given an integer array 'nums', return *the **third distinct maximum** number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the **maximum** number*.

Q4. Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

Q5. Given an array of integers arr, find the sum of 'min(b)', where 'b' ranges over every (contiguous) subarray of 'arr'.
 Since the answer may be large, return the answer **modulo** '109 + 7'.

Q6. Given a string array 'words', return *the* maximum value of 'length(word[i]) * length(word[j])' where the two words do not share common letters. If no such two words exist, return '0'.

Q7. Given a list of non-negative integers 'nums', arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.

Q8. 4. Minimum Size SubArray Sum Coding O REJECTEDGiven an array of positive integers nums and a positive
integer target, return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal totarget. If there is no such
subarray, returneinstead.Example 1:

Input: target= 7, nums [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal
length under the problem constraint.
